               site, and puts the URL to the paste in your "middle-click"
               clipboard.

screenshot2web: Lets you select a region of your screen with the mouse, then
                sends a screenshot of that area to a paste site, giving you
                back the URL in your clipboard.

video2web: Lets you select a region of your screen with the mouse, then records
           a screen capture of it. You guessed it - it also uploads to a paste
